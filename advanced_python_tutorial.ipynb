    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This module will cover intermediate and advanced Python topics -- installing and creating packages, data loading and saving, visualization tools, multiprocessing, functions and classes, and exceptions and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Anaconda & Spyder\n",
    "\n",
    "The great thing about Python is that it has so many packages (also called libraries or modules) written for it. But they're a pain to install yourself. The easiest way to install a \"scientific Python\" installation on your computer is with Anaconda:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything you need is preinstalled on the OCNC virtual machines, so if you're using that, you don't need to do anything. However, you are encouraged to set it up on your local computer, since you probably won't keep using the virtual machine after OCNC!\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda includes an \"interactive development environment\" (IDE) called Spyder, which provides a Matlab-like interface to Python. For big projects, it's much more flexible than a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 1.2 Pylab\n",
    "\n",
    "One useful way of using Python is by including the following at the top of your file:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import pylab as pl`\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "`from pylab import *`\n",
    "\n",
    "Pylab is a package that contains all the most commonly used scientific functions. The second line is basically just shorthand for\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from numpy import * # numerical functions like arrays, log, exp\n",
    "from scipy import * # scientific functions like interpolation\n",
    "from matplotlib.pyplot import * # plotting functions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `import pylab as pl` is more \"pythonic\" (and is strongly encouraged!), but `from pylab import *` lets you have the most Matlab-like environment. For example, the following is valid Python _or_ Matlab code!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pylab import * # comment out in matlab\n",
    "randomnumbers = randn(50,10);\n",
    "cumulativenumbers = cumsum(abs(randomnumbers));\n",
    "plot(cumulativenumbers);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(Caveat: these give slightly different results though!)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Exercise 1.2:</b><br>\n",
    "    (A) Run the code block in both Matlab and Python. <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Installing packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy, Pylab, and so forth are examples of _packages_. The easiest way to install packages in Python is with `pip` (package installer for python). This searches http://pypi.org for a package with that name, downloads it, and installs it, while you sit back and sip tea. Usually you would just do `pip install the_package_i_want`, but on the OCNC virtual machines you need a slightly different syntax: `python3 -m pip install the_package_i_want`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Sciris a bit later, but as a small preview, Sciris includes a data structure called an `odict`, which is another kind of ordered dictionary that also behaves like a list wherever possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pylab as pl\n",
    "import sciris as sc\n",
    "\n",
    "citations_dict = {'kenji doya':6363, 'erik de schutter':6366, 'eve marder': 27480}\n",
    "citations_odict = sc.odict({'kenji doya':6363, 'erik de schutter':6366, 'eve marder': 27480})\n",
    "\n",
    "total_citations = pl.array(citations_dict.values()).sum()\n",
    "total_citations = citations_odict[:].sum()\n",
    "\n",
    "alphabetized_dict = {key:citations_dict[key] for key in sorted(list(citations_dict.keys()))}\n",
    "alphabetized_odict = citations_odict.sorted()\n",
    "\n",
    "first_entry = alphabetized_dict[list(alphabetized_dict.keys())[0]]\n",

    "<b>Exercise 1.3:</b><br>\n",
    "    (A) If you're using the virtual machine: type \"python3 -m pip install sciris\" to install the Sciris package. Otherwise: type \"pip install sciris\".<br>\n",
    "    (B) Run the example code above. Extra credit (warning, difficult!): you can sort an odict by value with \"citations_odict.sorted(sortby='values')\". How would you create a regular dictionary sorted by value?\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Creating packages\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're working on a big project, you don't want everything in one file. To use functions from one file in another, you can import that file, just as you would `numpy` or `pylab`. For example, if you call your file `myfunction.py`, and inside that file you have defined `def myfunction()`, you would use it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import myfunction as myf\n",
    "output = myf.myfunction()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: this syntax of `nameofthing.nameofthing()` is frustratingly common in Python, but you will learn to see beauty in it. (Maybe.)\n",

    "<b>Exercise 1.4:</b><br>\n",
    "    (A) Convert the block of code from Exercise 1.2 into a function that returns `cumulativenumbers` (but doesn't plot), and save this as a separate file (e.g. \"exercise1.py\".<br>\n",
    "    (B) Create a new file (e.g. \"exercise1plot.py\") that imports this function, calls it, and then plots the results.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.5 Classes and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic approaches to programming: functional programming and object-oriented programming (OOP). One isn't \"better\" than the other, it depends on what you're trying to do. In general, you have data, and functions that do things on the data. In functional programming, you keep your data together in one place, and you keep your functions together in another place. In OOP, you keep data and functions together in an _object_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make it more concrete. Let's say you have you have a worm, a pigeon, and a cat. If you care about their _shared_ properties and functions that apply to all of them, you want to take a functional programming approach, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Functional approach\n",
    "\n",
    "masses = {'worm':0.002, 'pigeon':0.086, 'cat':7.3} # in kg\n",
    "velocities = {'worm':0.01, 'pigeon':9.6, 'cat':4.4} # in m/s\n",
    "\n",
    "def energy(mass, velocity):\n",
    "    return 0.5*mass*velocity**2\n",
    "\n",
    "print('Maximum kinetic energy for:')\n",
    "for animal in masses.keys():\n",
    "    KE = energy(masses[animal], velocities[animal])\n",
    "    print(f'{animal}: {KE}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it might also make more sense to treat each animal as an _object_ with properties/attributes (data) and methods (functions). That would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Object-oriented\n",
    "    \n",
    "class Animal():\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, mass, velocity):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.mass = mass\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these two approaches are **exactly equivalent**, it's just a matter of which one works better for you. OOP is almost always more work to set up initially, but can make life easier later. That said, for most of you most of the time, functional programming probably makes the most sense.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1.6 Multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing means running on multiple cores of your computer simultaneously. If you have a big simulation, for example, then if you can run it across 8 cores, it should finish 8 times faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This code gives an example of a computationally intensive function run in an \"embarrassingly parallel\" way (each run is completely independent). It should take 10-20 seconds in serial (depending on your computer), and be 2-8 times faster in parallel.\n",

    "There are two main kinds of debugging: figuring out why something crashed, and figuring out why something isn't as you expected. For the first, run your code, and after it crashes, type `%debug` in the console; that will put you in your program on the line it crashed. For the second, double-click on the line number you want to pause at; this will put in a _breakpoint_.

    "The problem with Matplotlib is that by default the plots it makes are kind of ugly. The simplest way to make them pretty is just to use one of the built-in styles, e.g. adapting our example above:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "pl.ylabel('y')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes high-quality plots stand out is typically how much customization is done _for that plot_. Default styles will only get you so far. The following code illustrates some common changes that can make plots look much better: fonts, transparency, spines (whether the plot is in a box or not), legends, and labels. Every aspect of Matplotlib can be customized, so if you can Google it, you can do it!\n",
