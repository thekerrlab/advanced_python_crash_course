# Advanced Python crash course

This tutorial was originally written for OCNC2019 at the Okinawa Institute for Science and Technology (2019). It is intended to take 2-3 hours, not counting the exercises at the end. Please adapt, copy, and steal freely, giving credit if you feel like it.

Usage: just type "jupyter notebook" and open the notebook. Most of the code from the notebook (and the solutions to the problems) are in the "exercises" folder.
